# ethicalengine

The idea of Ethical Engines is based on the <b>Trolley Dilemma</b>, a fictional scenario presenting a decision-maker with a moral dilemma: choosing ''the lesser of two evils''. The scenario entails an autonomous car whose brakes fail at a pedestrian crossing. As it is too late to relinquish control to the car's passengers, the car needs to make a decision based on the facts available about the situation.

<b>Ethical Engine</b> is a program designed to explore different scenarios, build an algorithm to decide between the life of the car's passengers vs. the life of the pedestrians, audit your decision-making algorithm through simulations, and allow users of your program to judge the outcomes themselves.
